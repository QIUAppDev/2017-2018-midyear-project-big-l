# JokeOfTheDay by Malik John & Jimmy Chen
Throughout the four years in Bronx Science, two of the biggest critics of the joke of the day, Mr. Perna and Mr. Cheung have complained that the joke of the day each day has been subpar for the most part. The app that will be designed will be one to assist the announcement makers with the joke of the day. In hopes to improve the joke of the day, a database of good jokes will be obtained and randomly generated each day at a click of button. In order to keep it different each day, it could be possible that an arraylist is done to hold the joke and once a joke is generated, the joke moves to the back of the queue. A possible alternative to the joke of the day could also be an inspirational quote, as also inspired by Mr. Cheung, allowing for the app to be used for a longer period of time and as a way to improve mental health.
